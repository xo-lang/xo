# std/template changes

## 2026-10-21: fix: printf, the escapers, eq, and slice as Go's text/template

- Kind: fix
- Commit: (filled in after the push)
- Found by: differential test against Go (scripts/stdcorpus template: 3,000 generated templates)
- Go reference: text/template exec.go, funcs.go (evalArgs, printableValue, eq, canCompare); fmt print.go and format.go (badVerb, printValue, fmtFloat); strconv ftoa.go fmtX (go1.26.1)
- Test: internal/stdtest/testdata/corpus/template

The native port differed from Go in eight ways:

- `%c` and `%q` of an integer that is not a code point faulted; they are U+FFFD now.
- `%U` of a negative printed it signed.
- A bad verb printed its value without the verb's width and precision (`%!f(string=   he)`).
- A nil inside a list or map printed as `%!d(<nil>)` instead of `<nil>`.
- Strings and bools were not padded with `0`.
- `%x` and `%X` of a float were bad verbs instead of hexadecimal floats.
- `html`, `js`, and `urlquery` printed a nil argument as `<nil>`, not `<no value>`.
- `eq` of a list and a map gave the single-type error.

`slice` of a string cut inside a rune now keeps the rest, with U+FFFD for
the cut bytes, where it gave "". On the Go backend the output is valid
text (decision 0259).

## 2026-10-21: port: std/template, Go's text/template

- Kind: port
- Commit: 2f308b5f
- Found by: survey (mail and config templates; decision 0299)
- Go reference: text/template parse/lex.go, parse/parse.go, parse/node.go, exec.go, funcs.go; fmt's print.go and format.go for printf (go1.26.1)
- Test: std/native/template_test.xo (Go's output and errors on 205 templates); internal/llvm/testdata/golden/template_basic (every backend)

New module over `json.Value` data: every action, pipeline, and built in
function of text/template with Go's output and error texts.
